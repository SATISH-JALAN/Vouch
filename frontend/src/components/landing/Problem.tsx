                Zcash hides everything by design. The only disclosure tool it gives you is a viewing key, and a viewing key is all-or-nothing:
                hand one to a lender, an accountant or an OTC desk and they see every payment you have ever received, permanently, including
                the ones that have nothing to do with them.

                underwritten or presented to a counterparty. The money is there. There is no way to show it is there.
