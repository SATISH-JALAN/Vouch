// Every preset is a real proof served from /proofs. The first was made by `pof-prove prove` from a
// real Zcash testnet wallet, against a testnet anchor rebuilt by pof-anchor. The rest were written
// by `pof-prove demo fixtures` (backend) and verify against the demo anchor: real Ironwood notes and
// real Halo2 proofs, in a published demo tree rather than the chain's. The page says so wherever a
// demo or testnet anchor is used.
